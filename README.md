# DarkChat
An all for all chat app in PHP. Named DarkChat because the bots will come!

Web based chat application that doesn't required any registration. Old PHP 4 and 5 and 7 compatible code I maintained and as such it looked like a mess. I originally made this to talk to people and prove that with good encoding a well designed database can accept any input. It was called SiteChat but renamed it to DarkChat because Google thinks this kind of thing is evil.

The configuration should be customised, copying config_default.php to config.php should theoretically speed the application up by a few nanoseconds.

If you have JavaScript, times should be local, tell me if otherwise. HTML only peoples the time is in GMT.

If you don't like the UI it can now be replaced in the configuration. Ignoring the concept of "instances" probably won't infer you are evil, I have no idea why anyone would want to use this feature.

I will bend over backwards to ensure this code base can work (by default) without JavaScript and look reasonable in ancient browsers.
