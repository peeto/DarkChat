# DarkChat
An all for all chat app in PHP. Named DarkChat because the bots will come!

Web based chat application that doesn't required any registration. Old PHP 4 and 5 and 7 compatible code I maintained and as such it looked like a mess. I originally made this to talk to people and prove that with good encoding a well designed database can accept any input. It was called SiteChat but renamed it to DarkChat because Google thinks this kind of thing is evil.

This will be modelled to be available in Composer and will be my ongoing piece of work on how to write modern code. It won't work with the first commit because of a previous hard disk failure. The old code does work however.
